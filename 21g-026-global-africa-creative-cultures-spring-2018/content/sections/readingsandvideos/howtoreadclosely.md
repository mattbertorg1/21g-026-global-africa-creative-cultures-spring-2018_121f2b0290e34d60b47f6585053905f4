1\. Know where the text is coming from

*   Who is the author?
*   When was the article written (general timeframe)?

2\. Get the story straight

*   Who are the actors in the stories told?
*   What are they doing / What are the various roles played in these stories?
*   How do the actors or roles relate to one another?
*   What are the implications of these interactions?

3\. Get the argument straight

*   What is the author arguing in the text (in my own words)?
*   What do I think of this argument?
*   Can I articulate a critique of it?
*   What questions remain unanswered for me?
*   What do I think of how the argument is articulated?
*   What theoretical concepts does the author leverage?
*   To what ends?

4\. Figure out what you’re supposed to take away

*   Why was this reading assigned?
*   What am I (supposed / expected) to take away from it?

5\. Put articles in conversation with each other

*   How do the \[X\] papers’ arguments differ?
*   How do they extend on each other? Contradict each other?
